## My most important tool is not a computer or an IDE - it is meditation

<img align="left" width="100" height="100" src="seven.jpg">
Through regular meditation I seek states of calmness and serenety, but my brain - that little rascal - now & then feels invited to create new questions, visions and stories to explore. That's how silence and emptiness become seeds for creativity and curiosity. 

I want my Github to represent my interest in **game development**, **computational arts** (and ... apparently [**BTS**](https://github.com/sereneWarrior/D3-BTS-Word-Distributions)❤️) and hopefully become more an more colorful and miraculous just as the ideas that come to me in contemplation.

## Projects I am eager to work on in the future:

- Awesome, epic, history themed adventure game 
- Painting or 3D graphic application
- Crowd AI in games
- Emotional AI for mental health care applications
- Digitalizing the human soul/ mind / consciousness
- (Translating this readme into korean and japanese ...)

------------------
## Technology/ applications/ projects I feel most inspired by:

- Vocaloid (Voice Synthesizer Software)
- Procreate
- Blender
- Pause (mindfulness application)
- [Fairy lights in Femtoseconds](https://digitalnature.slis.tsukuba.ac.jp/vision-en/) - tangible holograms (and holograms in general)
- [Dancer to piano performance system](https://www.yamaha.com/en/news_release/2018/18013101/) (Yamaha project)
