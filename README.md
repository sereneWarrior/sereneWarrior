Even though many facts may argue against it I first want to clarify here that **I am not a nerd**. I take this ⬆️ as a proof.[^1] You could rather consider me as a very, very, very inspired snowflake ❄️.

I want my GitHub to represent my interest in game development, computational arts and ... apparently [BTS](https://github.com/sereneWarrior/D3-BTS-Word-Distributions)❤️.

## Serenety, calmness & tranquility are qualities I seek through meditation. But my brain - that little rascal - now & then feels inspired to create new questions, visions and stories to explore. That's how silence and emptiness become the seed for creativity and curiosity - and meditation my most valuable tool.
